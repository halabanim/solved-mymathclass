<p class="ui header product-top-header" title=" MyMathClass Solution">Write a generic class MyMathClass with at type parameter T where T is a numeric object  (Integer, Double or any class that extends java.lang.number)Add a method standardDeviation (stdev) that takes an ArrayList of type T and returns a standard deviation  as type double.Use a for each loop where appropriate.

Hard code a couple of test arrays into your Demo file.You must use at least 2 different types such as Double and Integer.

Your call will be something like:

System.out.println(“Standard Deviation 0-9 “ + MyMathClass.stdev(a));

Your class and method headers will be:

public class MyMathClass&lt;T extends Number {public static &lt;T extends Number double stdev(ArrayList&lt;T a){

Research java’s Number class to see what useful method we are gaining access to.
